# A Mote in the Dark (furry-enigma)
My Ludum Dare 38 entry, A Mote in the Dark

# Hello!

  This is a very quick and dirty code I scrambled together in 72 hours for LD38. Initially it was meant to be a Compo entry, but as 42 hours neared its end I was nowhere near making it look like a game, so I had to move it into the jam.

# Be warned!

  The horrors you are about to see are a broken mess of "Oh my god I'm running out of time!" and "Oh god, oh god I didn't even start doing that other thing!". The usual mess I make in my code was amplified by rushing the codding and quick fixing bugs I was encountering.

P.S: probably should fix it some day...
